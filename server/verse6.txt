Have ever sat down and wonder what can become of your life
i have and every time i do that i just smile because i believe it will not jsut be okay
it will be awesome
we got the 
power and not 
just the power the height 
and width to determine what will become of us each day we raise
i know it 
sound delusion
not all it 
it is real and you got to believe me 
 because i know 
 and now you know.
